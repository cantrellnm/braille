# Braille Translator (English)

A Chrome extension that translates web pages into braille, forked from [andrewmacheret/braille](https://github.com/andrewmacheret/braille).

Changes: adds UEB contractions (groupsigns, wordsigns, shortforms), accented letters, a few misc. symbols. Only translates current page on button click instead of all pages until turned off. Improved viewing of original text (above braille or on hover) but slower on larger pages (optional).

**Note: rules & limitations for contractions are not enforced in current version. Translations will not always be accurate.**
